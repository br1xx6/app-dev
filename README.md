# 🏀 Coach Carter (2005)

A powerful and inspirational sports drama **based on a true story**.

The movie follows Ken Carter, who takes a job as the head basketball coach at his old high school, Richmond. He finds a team with a bad attitude and poor academic standing. To change this, he makes his players sign contracts that require them to maintain a good GPA and attend all their classes.

His methods are controversial, especially when he **locks the gym and benches his undefeated team** for failing to meet their academic goals.
